When a user selects a row in the table the corresponding columns fill a group of textfields so that the user can edit the information.  What I am trying to do is find out a clean approach to identifying which fields were edited once the user clicks save (so that I keep track of what changes were made by a user, and so that I only save what is necessary).  I have seen that I can use isModified() to see if a field has changed from its previous value, but calling this for every textfield seems to much.  So I am basically looking for a better approach for checking to see if a field has been modified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thank you";;
