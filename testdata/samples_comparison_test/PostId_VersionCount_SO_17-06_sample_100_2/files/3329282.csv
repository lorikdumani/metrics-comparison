In that school we authenticate users via LDAP, so there was an idea to do the same via school-site. On that site everything is working perfectly, but during developing I need very often to test if such solution works, of not. In order not to commit my changes so often I want to test this site on my local computer, but for connecting with LDAP i want to use ssh tunnel. In school network we have one server through witch we are connecting with inside of our school network. It's address is `phoenix.lo5.bielsko.pl`. Inside this network we have LDAP server with opened 389 and 636 ports. It's address is `auth.lo5`. I don't have access to `auth.lo5` via SSH, I can only connect with it to get some LDAP entries. So, I've tried to run SSH tunnel by running:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ssh -L 636:auth.lo5:636 hfaua@phoenix.lo5.bielsko.pl&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, I've set in my `/etc/hosts` that `auth.lo5` is pointing to `127.0.0.1`. I'm connecting to LDAP in PHP in such a way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ldap_connect('ldaps://auth.lo5', 636);&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I'm getting error `Can't contact LDAP server`. I think, that problem might be on `phoenix.lo5.bielsko.pl` in its SSH daemon config or in arguments passed to `ldap_connect()` function. Can you tell me, what should I set in sshd_config or in arguments passed to `ldap_connect` to get it working?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I posted the same question in [similar thread][1], but no one has answered my question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. In my `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` I have line `AllowTcpForwarding yes`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1244717/accessing-ldap-through-ssh-tunnel/";;
