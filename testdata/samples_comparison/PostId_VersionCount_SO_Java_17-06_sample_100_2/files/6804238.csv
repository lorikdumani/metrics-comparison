They are almost identical, but one list has a few more numbers that the second list doesn't have, and I want to find them. The only way I know to find them is to do `first.removeAll(second)` to find the difference. Is there another way?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ahmadsoft.org/articles/removeall/index.html";;added 412 characters in body
