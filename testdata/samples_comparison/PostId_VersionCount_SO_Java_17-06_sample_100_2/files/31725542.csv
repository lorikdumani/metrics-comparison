The servlet container isn't looking in your `jar` file for a `web.xml` file. That's simply not how it works. As you describe, your `web.xml` file must reference the filter explicitly otherwise the servlet container won't know to load it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're trying to use annotation-based loading, per the spec, referenced in [this post][1], it must be in `WEB-INF/classes` of the `war` file which your library is not, because it's in a separate `jar`. You might be able to achieve this if you configure your system to unpack `jar` files and repack all of them into a single `war` file.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://developer.jboss.org/thread/229917?tstart=0&_sscc=t";;
