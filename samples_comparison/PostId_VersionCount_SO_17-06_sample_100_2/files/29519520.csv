I want to produce a report based on the current record (easy), but with the primary key as the Where Condition (not so easy). I'm hoping to use the macro builder and avoid VBA, if possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the macro builder, I can easily get this done by inputting ""[First Name]=[Reports]![Contracts]![First Name]"" in the Where Condition. 'First Name' is just a regular field present in both my main table and the report. However, customer names can change easily so I'm hoping I can use the primary key ""Id"", as that should be a more reliable and unchanging value. But if I try with ""[Id]=[Reports]![Contracts]![Id]"", I get the whole 'Enter a Parameter' dialog (and even if I input the Id value, it just outputs every record).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why does this work with the First Name field but not the Id field? Is it because Access doesn't like to use primary keys for the Where Condition? If I use the expression builder, Access will recognize the Id field as present in my report and (therefore, I would think) as usable for this purpose. I'm assuming I'm missing something on the left of the equal sign? I've tried with Me. and Me! before and inside the brackets, but nothing. I've also tried stuff like ""[Tables]![Main]![Id]=[Reports]![Contracts]![Id]"" and ""[Main]![Id]=[Reports]![Contracts]![Id]"".&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for your help,&#xD;&#xA;Jaime";;
