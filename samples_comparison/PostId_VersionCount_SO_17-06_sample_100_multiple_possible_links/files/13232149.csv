I managed (after a long day of frustration) to cmake, make and install MathGL (even had to install libpng, but that's a differents story). So, I managed to add the MathGL include path (*/usr/local/include*) to the XCode C++ project and it is working, since the autocompletion autocompletes the `mgl2/mgl.h` header file.
