Community is important. It seems that most Windows developers that start with Rails quickly switch to a Mac or Linux. **However**, the small community of Windows Ruby users that do persist are extremely friendly, dedicated and knowledgeable - [**go say hi**][2].*)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note much of the advice that follows is now outdated due to the magnificent efforts of the [RubyInstaller][3] team in bringing stability, compatibility and performance to Ruby on Windows.
